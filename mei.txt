bac is a poopyhead

Git is best learned in practice. The more I use it, the easier and more natural it will become. I learned more from coding along than just listening, and the house and room metaphor really helped. Encouraging us to help each other fostered collaboration and I enjoyed both receiving and giving assistance. Thanks Bac!
