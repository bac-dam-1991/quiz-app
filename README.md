## How to open our app in the browser:

1. "npm -v" - Check if npm is installed on your system. If not,
2. Download and install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en)
3. "npm install -g create-react-app" - Install create-react-app globally if you haven't already
4. **"cd ui" - navigate to the ui folder (or whichever folder contains package.json)**
5. **"npm start" to run**
6. **The app should now open in the browser**
